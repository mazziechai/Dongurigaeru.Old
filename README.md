# Dongurigaeru: Ranked matchmaking on Discord

## How to contribute
This repository follows the [OneFlow Git workflow](https://www.endoflineblog.com/oneflow-a-git-branching-model-and-workflow). The steps for contributing are as follows:

1. If you don't have direct write access to the repository, create a fork or request direct write access. Note that only trusted contributors will be given direct write access.
2. Find an issue to work on. If an issue for the feature you'd like to work on doesn't exist, make a new one.
3. Create a branch for the issue. It's best to name it something related to the issue, such as the primary topic of the issue.
4. Push this new branch.
5. Once the branch is pushed, **create a pull request** to merge it with `main`, and link the respective issue to the pull request.
6. Work on the feature branch, pushing only commits that are related to the feature to that branch. If you have a change to another feature, follow the above steps again for that feature.
7. If the `main` branch is updated before your pull request is complete and updating the feature branch with the changes to `main` is necessary, **rebase** the feature branch to `main` and **force push**.
8. Get at least one review for your pull request and pass all tests before merging.
9. When merging the pull request, *ensure --ff-only and --squash are enabled*.
10. Once the feature branch is merged with main, the branch is automatically deleted.
